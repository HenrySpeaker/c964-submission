# Introduction to Sumo

Despite undergoing various transformations, sumo has existed as a sport since 710 AD. In Japan today, sumo is fought at the professional, collegiate, and amateur levels. In professional sumo, tournaments are held every other month (January, March, May, July, September, and November). The competitors, known as Rikishi, are ranked into one of six divisions and further ranked within their division.

A tournament lasts for 15 days, and rikishi within the top two divisions compete each day. The goal of every rikishi is to accumulate as many victories as possible during a tournament, with the winner accumulating the most among all competitors. Each rikishi's record in the previous tournament is used to adjust the rikishi's rank for the next tournament. Winning records earn promotions and losing records lead to demotions. Demotions can occur within a division, or, if the rikishi performs poorly enough, can lead to a demotion to a lower division.
